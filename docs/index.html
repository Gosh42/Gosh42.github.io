        <p>Hi. I'm Gosha, and this is my silly page.</p>
        <p>I'm a student studying software engineering, though most of my projects
            are art-related since that's what I did for most of my life and still do to this day.</p>
        <p>Stuff I do includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Art (the drawing kind)
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital</li>
                    <li>Traditional</li>
                    <li>Pixelated</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Silly photoshop edits</li>
            <li>Used to do animation, been quite a while though</li>
            <li>And of course the programming projects, though most are either incomplete or private. Still studying, y'know</li>
            <li>Other things that I either forgot to mention or deemed too insignificant to include</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'll add some cool stuff to this website later, like a gallery of my works.
            Meanwhile here's a silly <a href="https://youtu.be/qzKaTmjNalY">cat video</a> 
            while I'm still figuring out how making websites works.
